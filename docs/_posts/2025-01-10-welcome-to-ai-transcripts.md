# Welcome to AI Transcripts

This is the inaugural post for the AI Transcripts repository. This site will serve as a collection of AI conversation transcripts, technical discussions, and related documentation.

## What You'll Find Here

- **AI Conversations**: Detailed transcripts of interactions with AI assistants
- **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides created with AI assistance
- **Project Documentation**: Documentation for various AI-assisted projects
- **Learning Resources**: Educational content and explanations

## How It Works

All content on this site is written in Markdown format and stored in the `docs/_posts` directory. GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site whenever new content is pushed to the repository.

### Adding New Transcripts

To add a new transcript:

1. Create a new markdown file in `docs/_posts/`
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-transcript.md`
3. Include the Jekyll front matter at the top
4. Write your content in Markdown
5. Commit and push to GitHub

## Example Transcript Format

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Transcript Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [category1, category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---

Your transcript content here...
```

## Next Steps

Feel free to explore the repository, add your own transcripts, and customize the site to meet your needs. The Jekyll theme can be modified in `_config.yml`, and you can add custom styling as needed.
